# YouTube-Bookmark
A YouTube bookmark Chrome extension is a browser extension designed specifically for Google Chrome that enhances your YouTube experience by allowing you to bookmark and manage videos, playlists, or channels more efficiently.

A YouTube Bookmark only works on YouTube and allows you to add a bookmark(timestamp) in any youtube video by clicking the PLUS(+) icon at the bottom on the video itself.
You can review it later anytime by clicking the PLAY button and Delete it by clicking the BIN icon.
